This is an application for solving steady-state stochastic netowrks. It is a standalone Windows application that can also be run through Matlab for non-Windows users. 

For information about how to use the application please read the Manual.pdf.

The application file for the Windows standalone application can be found in the "Application" folder. The installation requires to downlod for free the Matlab Runtime R2017a; the Matlab Runitime can be found here http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html. Please follow the instructions to install the Matlab Runitime. After the the Matlab Runitime installation is complete, the ZICS application can be used through the ZICS.exe file and double click it. Follow the instructions.

In order to make the understanding of the application better, there are different netowrk examples that have been solved with ZICS app. The examples can be found int the "Example_Networks" folder.
